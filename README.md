I have built a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. I have trained the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.

### Introduction
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project I have developed a machine learning project – Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.

### Dataset
The datasets I have used consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.<br>
