# Realtime Face Mask Detection
## Technology Used: Python, OpenCV, and Keras
I have built a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. I have trained the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.

During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project I have developed a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
